    "# SR 11-7 Model Validation Automation\n",
    "\n",
    "> This notebook is part of a series made to demonstrate model validation practices based on the FED’s SR 11-7 guidance. Using LendingClub loan data from 2007 to 2018, we can simulate a full model lifecycle (data integrity -> documentation -> performance testing -> governance). This dataset includes both accepted and rejected loan applications allowing us to evaluate model behavior across funded and unfunded populations, benchmark risk segmentation, and simulate governance controls.\n",

    "\n",
    "Before validating a model, it's necessary to understand the integrity of the data it relies on. This notebook focuses on evaluating the completeness, consistency, and representativeness of the LendingClub dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll generate a structured data dictionary, quantify missingness and uniqueness across loan attributes, and surface potential issues that could compromise model reliability. These diagnostics help to ensure that our inputs are well-defined and suitable for downstream modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identify columns with high missingness or low cardinality\n",
    "- Flag potential data leakage or post-approval variables\n",
    "- Create intuitive documentation with readable styling & formatting.\n"
